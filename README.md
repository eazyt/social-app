Why should I take the course?

In the programming world, the “big 4” often consists of Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon. To get a job at any of these companies, you absolutely MUST know the essentials: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As well as this, it is becoming increasingly important to have experience with technologies such as Node.js and database systems such as MongoDB.

If you take this course, you will have nothing to worry about because we use all of these skills extensively!
